Soumika has a string S and its starting index is 1. The string S consists of characters from 1-9. As she is very intelligent, she wants to test his brother Vinay Tendulkar. She asked her brother Vinay Tendulkar to count the number of even numbered characters ( i.e 2,4,6,8 ) for every index i (1<=i<=|S|). For an index i, the result should be calculated from i to the end of the string. As Vinay doesn't know about programming, he wants you to help him find the solution.

Input:
First line contains a string S.

Output:
Print |S| space-separated integers,the result of every index.

Constraints:
1 â‰¤ |S| â‰¤ 104
