Given two integers - n and r, your task is to calculate the combinatorial nCr.
nCr = n! / r! (n-r)!
The caveat is that you have to write code to do this calculation in minimum number of characters.

UPDATE: The testcases for this problem have been fixed. Please try submitting your solution again.

Input
The first line will be number of testcases T. Then T lines follow, each containing two positive integers - n and r.

output
Print T lines, each line containing the value of nCr.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= r <= n <= 1000

You can assume that the value nCr will fit into a signed 64 bit integer.

Code
===
d={}
d[1]=1
def ft(n):
	if n in d.keys():
		return d[n]
	else:
		f = n*ft(n-1)
		d[n]=f
		return f
t = input()
while t >0:
	n,r = (int(i) for i in raw_input().split())
	rs = ft(n)/(ft(r)*ft(n-r))
	print rs
	t -=1
