The Monk wants to buy some cities. To buy two cities, he needs to buy the road connecting those two cities. Now, you are given a list of
roads, bought by the Monk. You need to tell how many cities did the Monk buy.

Input:
First line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer E, denoting the
number of roads. The next E lines contain two space separated integers X and Y, denoting that there is an road between city X and city Y.


Output:
For each test case, you need to print the number of cities the Monk bought.

Constraint:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= E <= 1000
1 <= X, Y <= 10000

 #take the road ends into a dictionary. At the end only distinct values will be saved in the dictionary.
 # so take a count to get the number of cities brought by Monk
